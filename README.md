# A journey to exercise TDD, unit test, and writting testable code

- Implement in Pair Programming
- Switch roles after each TDD cycle
- Create branch with your group name
- Push you code to unlock next challenge

### Scenario: Implement a Fizz Buzz game
#### Challenge 1
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100, with delimiter `, `.

- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number 
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

Sample output:
```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, ...
```
etc up to 100
